# tmux_config
.tmux.config
this is my personal tmux setup, if you want you can also use it. It is a simple tmux script it uses navigation in vim fasion so to move you can use hjkl keys and scroll is on and to split terminal use ctrl+a then press v for vertical split and h for horizontal split

*these are only its function if you want you can add stuff to your liking*
